# connect4_game
This repo shows my own version of the infamous connect four game and code behind it. I have adapted my version to allow players to enter their names to play. The game is only played by two players at a time with the first player assigned the colour red and the second assigned the colour blue. To win the game, one of the two players must consecutively align four of their coloured pieces in the horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction.
Hope you enjoy the game!
